This is my take on [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about).

You may find here a package for each day of the project, as well as an `extra` one that contains some boilerplate
functions I use often.

This year I gave a try to _golang_, it is the first project I write in this language, so any feedback on idiomatic
changes is most welcome.
